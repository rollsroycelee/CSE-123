## Problem Description
Consider a class `Location` that stores information about places as a pair of latitude-longitude coordinates. Each location keeps track of its name (a string), its latitude (a real number), and its longitude (a real number).

Modify the class to be `Comparable` by adding an appropriate `compareTo` method. Locations should be ordered first by latitude with locations closer to the equator (closer to 0) considered less than locations farther from the equator. When the latitudes are equal, you should examine longitudes with locations closer to the prime meridian (closer to 0) considered less than locations farther from the prime meridian.

You may assume that your constructor is passed legal values for latitude and longitude. Use the Math.abs method to find the absolute value of a number.
