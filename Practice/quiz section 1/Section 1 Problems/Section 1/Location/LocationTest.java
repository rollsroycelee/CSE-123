     * TA Note - oftentimes when you have tests that run more than once,
     *           it can be useful to create "helper methods" in your test
     *           file, rather than to copy-paste code in every testing method.
     *           Of course, you should be careful when doing this - if there's a bug
     *           in your regular program, your tests should catch it. If there's a bug
     *           in your tests, on the other hand, those can be very difficult to find
     *           (because the first thought is usually never "there's a problem in
    *            my tests...")!
