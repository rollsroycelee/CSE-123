## Description

One of the TAs was writing a set of classes to keep track of their pets. Unfortunately, they skipped the inheritance lecture and now have a problem on their hands! Help the TA out by fixing their implementation of the `Dog`, `Cat`, `Doberman`, and `Tiger`! Your goal is to reduce redundancies between these classes and cut out unnecessary code! Altering the code should not change the original output of the classes. 

## Challenge Question:

How could we use inheritance to reduce redundancy even further? Are there components shared between the `Dog` and `Cat` classes?
